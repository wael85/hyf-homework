          <h2>PRACTICAL WEB DEVELOPMENT</h2>
          <P>Since the commercialization of the web, web development has been a growing industry. 
            The growth of this industry is being driven by businesses wishing to use their website 
            to sell products and services to customers.
            [1] There is open source software for web development like BerkeleyDB, 
            GlassFish, LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack and Perl/Plack. 
            This has kept the cost of learning web development to a minimum.
            Another contributing factor to the growth of the industry has been 
            the rise of easy-to-use WYSIwYG web-develop- ment software,
            such as Adobe Dreamweaver, BlueGriffon and Microsoft Visual Studio.
            Knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML) or of programming languages is still 
            required to use such software, but the basics can be learned and implemented quickly
            with the help of help files, technical books, internet tutorials or face-to-face training
            An ever-growing set of tools and technologies have helped developers builid more dynamic
            and interactive websites. Further, web developers now help to deliver applications
            as web services which were traditionally only available as applica tions on a desk-based
            computer. This has allowed for many opportunities to de- centralize information and media
            distribution. Examples can be seen with the rise of cloud services such as Adobe Creative 
            Cloud, Dropbox and Google Docs. These web services allow users to interact with
            applications from many locations instead of being tied to a specific workstation 
            for their application environment

                WEB DEVELOPMENT AS AN INDUSTRY 
        </H3>
        <P>  Examples of dramatic transformation in communication and commerce
             led by web development include e-commerce.  Online auction sites 
             such as eBay have changed the way consumers find and purchase goods and services.  
             Online retailers such as Amazon.com and Buy.com 
             (among many others) have transformed the shopping and bargain-hunting 
             experience for many consumers.
